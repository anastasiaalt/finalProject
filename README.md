Description

This is a forum to discuss professional stress and anxiety at work.

A user must submit an application or a LinkedIn profile to join the community. However, users are anonymized and appear only as a gender and industry combination (e.g. male management consultant).

From there, the user can post brief (250 words max) descriptions of problems they are facing at work or issues that are causing them stress.
The user must also describe the "worst case scenario" (e.g. loses job and family ridicules him) in designated area of the post.

Other users in the community can post replies to this problem and offer ways to reframe the issue more positively.
Any user in the community can upvote or downvote the responses based on how helpful they find them.

To create the database, I will use Mongo. The web app will be a single page application using Angular, Express, and Node as well.
I will also use Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
